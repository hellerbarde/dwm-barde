This is my version of the _dynamic window manager_ from http://dwm.suckless.org. I applied some patches and decided to version it together with my configuration. So there we are.

Patches applied:
  * [transparency](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/transparency)
> > transparency support. (needs some composite manager running)
  * [statuscolors](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors)
> > support for colors in the statusbar
  * [focusonclick](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/focusonclick)
> > Enables a boolean variable to configure the behaviour of focus.
  * [nametag](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/nametag)
> > Makes it possible to rename a tag on the fly
  * [pertag](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag)
> > ever felt like having a seperate layout per tag? I did!
  * [push](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/push)
> > rotate clients around in the stack (for the juggling on this patch, see changeset [e9402d5c3e78](https://code.google.com/p/dwm-barde/source/browse/?r=e9402d5c3e78))
